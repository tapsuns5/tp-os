# 100 Days of Code: What I learned

### **Why I Started 100 Days of Code**

My love for software has grown exponentially over the years. It started in 2018 when I was running a local business and needed to figure out how to improve our marketing site and leads. That then turned into how we could use the marketing site to reduce costs and build a booking platform on top of it. This is when I was introduced to the possibilities of what you could really do on the web. This was not coding from scratch, as we were hacking up a WordPress site, but everyone has to start somewhere. This was my somewhere.

### **How I Found 100 Days of Code**

I was browsing X/Twitter as usual and came across a web designer I have followed for a while. They had re-posted an individual currently doing the 100 days of code challenge. I found the site [100 Days of Code] and dug into what the challenge was all about. Here is what stuck out to me.

- Anyone can do this regardless of skill level


- You need to commit to 1 hour a day of coding


- Hold yourself accountable by posting on X/Twitter and their Discord channel


### **Current Progress**

I am currently on Day 11 of my coding journey. So far, I have learned the following;

- I have learned the basics of HTML elements


- I have learned the basics of CSS styling


- I have learned how to link a CSS style sheet to an HTML document and also inline style HTML elements


- I have learned how to develop an HTML &amp; CSS document using VS Code locally


- I have learned more fundamentals of web development and using the tools for web development


I always knew I would enjoy coding once I could commit to it. I like being able to create. I like learning new things that enhance my skill set and ability to create for myself and my family.

I am enjoying my journey so far and look forward to what will come of this. I highly recommend joining the challenge if you struggle with committing and taking that next step. It is more about self-accountability than anything else. Something we all need at times for whatever we do.
